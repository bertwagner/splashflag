3D printing the files shouldn't require any supports, with the exception of the cutout for the USB-C cable. I used .10mm layer heights with PLA+ filaments. The snap-fit tactile button is the component with the tightest dimensional tolerance - I recommend slicing up the back panel and printing only this button enclosure at first to ensure your printer is calibrated correctly. If that piece prints correctly, the rest of the case should print without any issues.
